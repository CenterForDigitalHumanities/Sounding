                    A book, though it may feel like permanent and stable format, may be as difficult to ensnare
                    as the ideas and art it contains. Through history, books are rebound in different orders and
                    gatherings, destroyed in whole or in part, cut apart for sale as collectibles, or otherwise
                    decomposed from the codex it was originally presented as. In other cases, documents existed
                    for a long time before being gathered into a codex which comprises the canonical version. A
                    need to reorder, assemble, and describe individual pieces of a book with precision arises.

                    This site expands the capabilities of the <a href="http://brokenbooks.org">Broken Books project</a>,
                    which constructs the famously broken, pre-modern manuscript known as the <cite>Llangattock Breviary</cite>.
                    The focused effort quickly hatched new projects and highlighted the need for a version of
                    the tools used in Broken Books that risked breaking the careful schema and control needed for
                    the seminal Llangatock project.

                    The power behind the digital reconstruction is
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://iiif.io/model/shared-canvas/1.0/index.html">SharedCanvas</a> technology
                    and the <a target="_blank" href="http://iiif.io">International Image Interoperability Framework</a> (IIIF).
                    Using these standards we can create surrogates that anchor the digital images and descriptive annotations
                    of the relevant leaves. The original goal, of reconstructing a dismembered manuscript remains,
                    but Deep Codex hopes to expand that possibilities to allow virtual manuscript creation and the
                    generation of multiple sequences for the same manuscript. Even for intact codices, the possibility
                    of complex structures for navigation, flexible annotation and metadata, and open community contributions
                    represents a real advance for the IIIF standard.

                        One important component of Deep Codex is the ability for anyone to contribute at any level they want.
                        The interface offers infinite fields for metadata, image linking, and the ability to place the leaf
                        within a structure for logical construction. Users can fill out as much or as little information
                        about the leaf as they wish.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Project owners are given the ability to construct and set up the organizational structure of the book or
                        manuscript they want to rebuild.  This structure then receives uploaded leaves that can be placed within it. Leaves
                        that are contributed are reviewed and once approved can be placed within the publicized structure, which continually
                        redefines where leaves are still missing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The publicized structure with its recovered leaves can be viewed online by any user who would like to read or study it.
                        Deep Codex uses the <a href="https://projectmirador.org">Mirador viewer</a> for these purposes.
