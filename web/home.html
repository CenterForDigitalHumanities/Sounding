                Broken Books Description
            </h3>
            <p>
                Often times in history books are taken apart, "broken" into pieces and dispersed.  Our site
                allows for the virtual reconstruction of one of these broken books, the pre-modern manuscript known as the
                Llangattock Breviary and continues to be developed so that any book can be digitally reconstructed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deriving its nickname from a later owner, John Allan Rolls, the 1st Baron Llangattock, 
                the Breviary was sold at Christie's, London in 1958. After the sale, this manuscript was broken 
                apart and the separated leaves were sold on the American market by a dealer from Boston. 
            </p>  
            <p>
                Working with collaborative partners, including many members of Digital Scriptorium, we have collected
                digital images of this book's leaves from institutions and private collections all over the world, 
                including Harvard, U.C. Berkeley, the American Academy in Rome, University of South Carolina, 
                Michigan State, Dartmouth, the Hill Monastic Manuscript Library, the Biblioth√®que Nationale
                in Paris and the Museo Schifanoia in Ferrara. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The power behind the digital reconstruction is <a>shared canvas</a> technology 
                and the <a>International Image Interoperability Framework</a> (IIIF).
                Using these innovative tools we can create canvases that hold the digital images 
                of the relevant leaves and annotatations to store metadata about them.
                These canvases will be grouped in pairs so that users can attach annotations, 
                including cataloging metadata, to individual images or to a whole leaf, with the goal of virtually 
                reconstructing the original manuscript.
