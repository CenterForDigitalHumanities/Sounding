            <h3>
                Welcome to Broken Books
            </h3>
            <p>
                Often times in history books are taken apart, "broken" into pieces and dispersed.  Our site
                allows for the virtual reconstruction of one of these broken books, the pre-modern manuscript known as the
                Llangattock Breviary and continues to be developed so that any book can be digitally reconstructed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deriving its nickname from a later owner, John Allan Rolls, the 1st Baron Llangattock, 
                the Breviary was sold at Christie's, London in 1958. After the sale, this manuscript was broken 
                apart and the separated leaves were sold on the American market by a dealer from Boston. To view the
                Digital Scriptorium implementation of this digital object, you can go to 
                <a href="https://brokenbooks.omeka.net/exhibits/show/llangattock">OMEKA here</a>.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Working with collaborative partners, including many members of Digital Scriptorium, we have collected
                digital images of this book's leaves from institutions and private collections all over the world, 
                including Harvard, U.C. Berkeley, the American Academy in Rome, University of South Carolina, 
                Michigan State, Dartmouth, the Hill Monastic Manuscript Library, the Biblioth√®que Nationale
                in Paris and the Museo Schifanoia in Ferrara. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The power behind the digital reconstruction is <a target="_blank" href="http://iiif.io/model/shared-canvas/1.0/index.html">shared canvas</a> technology 
                and the <a target="_blank" href="http://iiif.io">International Image Interoperability Framework</a> (IIIF).
                Using these innovative tools we can create canvases that hold the digital images 
                of the relevant leaves and annotatations to store metadata about them.
                These canvases will be grouped in pairs so that users can attach annotations, 
                including cataloging metadata, to individual images or to a whole leaf, with the goal of virtually 
                reconstructing the original manuscript.

                One component of Broken Books is the ability for anyone to contribute at any level they want.  The interface
                offers a multitude of fields for metadata, image upload ability and the ability to place the leaf within
                a structure an administrator has prepared.  Users are required to submit at minimum ONE piece of 
                information about the leaf they are suggesting, which means you can fill out as much or as little information
                about the leaf as feels comfortable.  <a href="../brokenBooks/putInBucket.html?demo=1">Contribute a leaf here!</a>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Administrators are given the ability to construct and set up the organizational structure of the digital
                resource they are reconstructing.  This structure waits for leaves to be placed within the sections.  Leaves
                that are contributed are reviewed by the administrator and once approved are placed within the publicized
                structure.  <a href="../brokenBooks/sort_order.html?demo=1">Click here to construct.</a>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The publicized structure with its pages can be viewed and paged through like reading the book by everyone
                who would like to read it.
